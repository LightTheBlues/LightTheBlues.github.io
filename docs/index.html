				<ul>
					<li>Controller Area Network (CAN) is a data communication protocol utilized for broadcasting data and managing control systems.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The CAN protocol is a cost-effective communication option with real-time capabilities suitable for complex electrical environments.Various boards support the CAN protocol.</li>
					<br>
					<li>CAN is versatile and finds applications in a wide range of fields. While initially designed for interconnecting automotive devices, it has expanded into various industries. Crucial use-cases include agricultural equipment, navigational equipment, mechanical control, aircraft fueling systems, medical instruments, maritime applications such as ships, lighting control systems, and robotics.
			For example, medical equipment manufacturers have integrated CAN into medical devices, and hospitals utilize CAN-based systems to control room components like lights, cameras, and X-ray machines.

			   <h2>Our Goal :</h2>
			   		<ul>
						<p>The main goal of this project is to gain a basic understanding of control area network (CAN) protocols and embedded programming via implementation onto dsPIC33CK1024MP710 Family microcontrollers. With hands-on experimentation and observation of the dsPIC33EV 5V CAN-LIN STARTER KIT capabilities, preparation and eventual implementation for CAN protocol onto the dsPIC33C Touch-CAN-LIN curiosity development board can be made. </p>
						<br>
						<p>We try to implement: </p>
							<li>CAN-FD protocols on curiosity</li>
							<li>CAN 2.0 protocols on curiosity</li>
							<li>Sending and receiving capabilities for various message types between curiosity and starter boards</li>
							<li>Collision detection and handling of arbitration</li>
							<li>Connection between boards to simulate a CAN bus network</li>
							<li>An Website database showcase</li>

            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <p>
                If you click "Menu" and "Start Now", you may see transmitting and receiving logs. <br>
                Those consist of timestamps, communication type - TX, RX -, ID, and some data derived from the communications. <br>
